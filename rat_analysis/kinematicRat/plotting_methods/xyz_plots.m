function ret = xyz_plots(track_marker, swing_times)
% track_marker - the marker plotted (often the endpoint/toe marker is used)
% swing_times - the times at which swing begins and ends

%% DOUBLE CHECK that these inputs make sense given how I save the data. 

%% PLOT: x, y, and z vs time. x, y, and z averages of steps.
